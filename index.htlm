We are based out of the <strong>tri-county</strong> Metropolitan <em>Detroit</em> 
area. </span> Our mission is <u>provide</u> customers with a better and more informed 
choice when it comes to deciding on heathy holistic products for their 
body. We have <s>stores</s> and a website for your convenience to make your
purchase of our list of products. After reading <cite>The Pill Box</cite> by 
Harold M. Silverman and reading all the possible side effects from conventional
medicine, I decided to create this website to provide consumers with a more
natural approach when it comes to healing and staying healthy. A <dfn>side effect
</dfn> is the bodies reaction to an unatural substance ingested into the blood
stream of the body.  <!-- inline equivalent to div element -->

  <h1>Smoking Cigarettes and Side Effects</h1>
  <p>No matter how you smoke it, tobacco is dangerous to your health. There are 
no safe substances in any tobacco products, from acetone and tar to nicotine and 
carbon monoxide. The substances you inhale don't just affect your lungs. They 
can affect your entire body.
Smoking can lead to a variety of ongoing complications in the body, as well as 
long-term effects on your body systems. While smoking can increase your risk of a
 variety of problems over several years, some of the bodily effects are 
immediate. </p>

  <h1>The Best Home Remedies to Quit Smoking</h1>
  <p class="clear">While it can be very difficult to give up smoking, there are a number of 
effective ways to do so. And some of the best ones can actually be found in your 
own home. You don't have to pay for expensive medicines or patches to try to 
counter the nicotine cravings. Instead, you can use items commonly found around 
your house to help you conquer your addiction.

  <li>Ginger - nauseous</li>
  <li>Vitamins - restoration</li>
  <li>Ginseng - Cravings</li>
